    <p>I'm Nobody! Who are you?
    </p>
      Are you - Nobody - Too?
    </p>
      Then there's a pair of us!
    </p>
      Don't tell! They'd banish us - you know!
    </p>
      How dreary - to be - Somebody!
    </p>
      How public - like a Frog -
    </p>
      To tell one's name - the livelong June - To an admiring Bog!
