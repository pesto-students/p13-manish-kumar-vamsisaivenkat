    <p>I'm Nobody! Who are you?

      Are you - Nobody - Too?
      
      Then there's a pair of us!
      
      Don't tell! They'd banish us - you know!
      
      How dreary - to be - Somebody!
      
      How public - like a Frog -
      
      To tell one's name - the livelong June - To an admiring Bog!
